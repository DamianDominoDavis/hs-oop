Did we provide example game configurations? Did I get a biary? I admit I didn't look.

Instances of super() without class and self, and other 2.x artifacts. Just, everywhere. It needs cleanup for 3.x.

More of our delightfully could-have-been-benign text boxes for given code. And this is the more complex stuff they'll probably copy longhand incorrectly and waste time reviewing to "spot the bug" without teaching them anything.

A unified Node class is very appealing here. In theory, all three structures are in play.

ex05: it isn't super obvious that the board instance variable is a two-dimensional array of Queues, I had one kid asking me why the Queues had a length now if they didn't before. Rephrase.

List comprehensions would have come in handy here. Too bad.

Do we teach how to raise errors, trying to catch them, in intro? That would be useful during many of the board functions that take any old row and column.
